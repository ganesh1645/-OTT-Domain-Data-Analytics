# 🎬 OTT Domain Data Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from the *Over-The-Top (OTT) streaming industry* to uncover meaningful insights about content trends, user preferences, and platform performance.


## 📊 Project Overview

The OTT industry has grown rapidly, with multiple platforms competing to attract users through diverse content.  
This project uses real-world OTT data to perform *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* and generate visual insights that help understand:

- What type of content dominates OTT platforms (Movies vs TV Shows)
- The most popular *genres, **countries, and **release years*
- How content trends have evolved over time
- Key factors that influence the availability and diversity of content


## 🧠 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the OTT dataset  
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies  
- Explore key attributes such as *Title, **Genre, **Country, **Release Year, and **Ratings*  
- Visualize patterns and correlations between different variables  
- Draw actionable insights for OTT business strategy

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

| Category | Tools / Libraries |
|-----------|------------------|

| Version Control | GitHub |


## 🔍 Key Insights

- Movies dominate OTT platforms more than TV Shows.  
- Drama, Comedy, and Action are the most common genres.  
- Significant growth in OTT content additions after 2015.

- Distribution of *Release Years*  
- Heatmap showing correlation between attributes  
- Country-wise content analysis  
- Trend line showing number of titles added per year  


## 🧩 Workflow

1. *Data Collection:* Imported OTT dataset (CSV/Excel format).  
2. *Data Cleaning:* Removed null values, standardized column names, formatted date fields.  
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* Used Pandas & Seaborn for in-depth analysis.  
4. *Visualization:* Created charts to summarize trends and patterns.  
5. *Insights & Summary:* Interpreted results with business-oriented conclusions.


## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add user ratings/viewership data to correlate with content performance.  
- Build a *predictive model* to forecast content trends.  
- Create an *interactive dashboard* using Power BI or Plotly Dash.  
- Compare content strategies across multiple OTT platforms.
